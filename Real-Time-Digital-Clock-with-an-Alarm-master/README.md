# Real-Time-Digital-Clock-with-an-Alarm
This project is an implementation of a real-time digital clock with an alarm, which is controlled by a PIC18F4550 microcontroller with an internal oscillator of 8 MHz. The aim of this project is to implement the inter-integrated circuit (I2C) communication protocol on the PIC microcontroller to control a serial real-time clock (DS1307). 

The project requirement is designing a digital clock system that allows for time and date updating. In addition, an internal alarm system can be configured to a specific time with choosing alarming LED pattern.
